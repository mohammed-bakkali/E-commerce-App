dispatch:  in Redux is a function used to send (fire) Actions to the Store. These actions describe what is happening in the application, and can be something like fetching data from the API, updating the user's state, or modifying an item in the cart.

What is dispatch:

When you call dispatch(action), you are telling Redux that a change needs to happen.

An Action is a regular object that describes the type of change (with optional data called payload).

After the action is dispatched, it is passed to the Reducers, which update the State based on the type of action.


When dispatch is called, an Action is sent (or fired) to the Store in Redux, which handles this Action based on its type, executes it via Middleware (such as redux-thunk) and passes it to the Reducer to update the State.
